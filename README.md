# HarvardX-CS50-Web-Project0
This is my Project 0 from the HarvardX CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. My webpage goes over the Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Chordata, and has a separate page on every class in Chordata (Reptilia, Amphibia, Chondrichthyes, Agnatha, and Mammalia. The navigation bar, located under the "Kingdom Animalia" title, is present among every page. It implements a mobile-responsive @media query to wrap the links in a column on smaller devices. Every site also contains a banner image specific to the certain page. In the homepage (index.html), I used Bootstap's columns to add an overview and an unordered list next to each other. On smaller devices, the columns take up the entire 12 columns. The unordered list also contains links to every page. Next, in the Reptilia page, it also uses bootstrap's columns model, on one side having an overview and a list of groups. Then on the right having a table. Moving on to the Amphibia page on the left it contains an overview, and on the right, it uses a Bootstrap component to switch the image. Chondrichthyes, Agnatha and Mammalia page all use the same template I made from the previous pages.
